# Spiel - German for "game"
Spiel is a sort of cross between pong and snake. The player controls two paddles, one on the left and one on the right to
bounce a ball about a field, as every few seconds an "enemy ball" is spawned, and every time the playerr's ball hits a 
paddle, it gains length in its "tail." You lose by colliding with the left and right fields or an enemy ball
